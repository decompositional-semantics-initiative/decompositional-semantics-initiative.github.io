Cross-lingual semantic parsing involves mapping content provided in a source language into a meaning representation based on a target language. The X-DSP system does this using two components: (i) a meaning representation designed to allow systems to target varying levels of structural complexity (shallow to deep analysis); and (ii) an end-to-end model with a novel copy mechanism that supports intrasentential coreference.

The X-DSP system was originally described in the following paper.
