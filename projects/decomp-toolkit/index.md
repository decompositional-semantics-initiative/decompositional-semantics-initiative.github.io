Decomp is a toolkit for working with the Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) dataset, which is a collection of directed acyclic semantic graphs with real-valued node and edge attributes pointing into Universal Dependencies syntactic dependency trees.

If you make use of the dataset and/or toolkit in your research, we ask that you please cite the following paper in addition to the paper that introduces the underlying dataset(s) on which UDS1.0 is based.
