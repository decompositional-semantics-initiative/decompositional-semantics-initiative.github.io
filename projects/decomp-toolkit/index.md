The Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) dataset represents a unified approach to semantic annotation that combines multiple semantic annotation layers into a single graph-based representation. UDS graphs consist of directed acyclic structures where nodes and edges carry real-valued attributes, with these semantic graphs anchored to Universal Dependencies syntactic trees.

The Decomp toolkit provides Python 3 libraries for working with UDS data, offering SPARQL-based querying capabilities for semantic graph exploration. The toolkit enables researchers to access and analyze the normalized semantic annotations that span multiple linguistic phenomena including semantic roles, factuality, genericity, and temporal relations.

UDS 1.0 integrates five annotation datasets collected using crowdsourcing methodologies, where complex semantic phenomena are decomposed into simple binary questions. This decompositional approach allows naive annotators to provide reliable judgments that are then aggregated and normalized into continuous-valued semantic properties.
