PredPatt is a framework for extracting extensible, interpretable, language-neutral predicate-argument patterns that bridge from the deep syntax of the Universal Dependency project to an initial shallow semantic layer. This shallow semantic layer forms the basis for Decomp-aligned semantic annotations on Universal Dependency treebanks and can be separately considered a linguistically well-founded component of a *Universal IE* system.
