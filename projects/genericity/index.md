An important line of study in formal semantics, philosophy, and AI investigates how language is used to represent knowledge of kinds, regularities and patterns. For instance, how do we know that *lions roar* describes a generalization about a kind of thing (lions), while *those lions roared* describes a specific event in which particular lions participated?

In this line of work, we propose a novel framework for capturing linguistic expressions of generalization. We suggest that linguistic expressions of generalization should be captured in a continuous multi-label system, rather than a multi-class system. We do this by decomposing categories such as EPISODIC, HABITUAL, and GENERIC into simple referential properties of predicates and their arguments.
