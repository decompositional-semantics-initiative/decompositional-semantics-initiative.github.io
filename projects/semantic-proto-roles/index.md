A substantial amount of both computational and linguistic research on event representations has focused on categorical, coarse thematic roles such as *AGENT* and *PATIENT*.  In spite of this, there is evidence going back to Dowty 1991 that this is the wrong grain size to look for thematic information: the appearance of roles like *AGENT* represents a conglomeration of finer-grained thematic properties such as *causation*, *volition*, *change-of-state*, etc.  

In this line of work, we develop a semantic proto-role annotation task, and shown that it readily leads to quality annotations with minimal training in crowd-sourcing situations. Decomposing thematic roles into fine-grained proto-role properties provides both theoretical and practical gains: not only does it lead to a better account of the mapping of semantic representations to syntax, it also leads to more tractable semantic annotation tasks.
