ParaBank!

For a detailed description of the datasets and the item construction and collection methods as well as models of these data, please see the following papers:

> Hu, J. E., R. Rudinger, M. Post, & B. Van Durme. 2019. [ParaBank: ...](http://something). Proceedings of AAAI 2019, Honolulu, Hawaii, January 26 â€“ Feb 1, 2019.


If you make use of these datasets in a presentation or publication, we ask that you please cite both of these papers. Additionally, if you use any recast NLI dataset, we ask that you please cite the original dataset that we previously recast (we provide a bibtex entry for each dataset [online](https://github.com/decompositional-semantics-initiative/DNC/blob/master/additional_references.md)).
