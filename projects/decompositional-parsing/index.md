A structured account of compositional meaning has
been longstanding goal for both natural language
understanding and computational semantics. To
this end, a number of efforts have focused on encoding semantic relationships and attributes in a
semantic graph.

In these formalisms, semantic information is typically encoded discretely, using nominal category
labels for nodes and edges. This categorical encoding can make such formalisms brittle when presented with non-prototypical instances, and leads
to challenges in coping with changing label ontologies and new datasets. Furthermore, they are difficult to annotate, often requiring
trained linguists and large annotation manuals.

We develop joint UDS parsers, which
learn to extract both graph structures and attributes
from natural language input.
